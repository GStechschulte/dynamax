    "# Low-Rank Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) assume that our $X$ observations can be explained by set of hidden state variable, $z$, each which can take on one of $K$ discrete values. \n",
    "That is, we assume that we have $z_t \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$, where $z_t = k$ denotes that the hidden variable is in state $k$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We further assume that this hidden state evolves over time $t$ with some set of transition probabilities.\n",
    "The key assumption in an HMM is that only the most recent state affects the next state: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(z_t \\mid z_{t-1}, z_{t-2}, \\ldots, z_1) = p(z_t \\mid z_{t-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we don't observe the state $z_t$ itself; instead, we get a noisy observation of the state at each time step according to some observation model.\n",
    "We'll use $x_t$ to denote the observation at time step $t$ and use $D$ to refer to the dimensionality of the observation, since this can be either a vector or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Gaussian HMM, each discrete state $z_t = k$, is associated with a $D$-dimensional mean $\\mu_k$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma_k$ which jointly determine the _emission probability distribution_. Thus, each probability distribution is a Gaussian centered at $\\mu_k$ and with covariance $\\Sigma_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-rank Gaussian HMMs further assume that each covariance matrix of our Gaussian emission probabilities is _low-rank_; that is, that it can be well-modelled as a perturbation of a diagonal matrix."
